# IZOS
IZOS is a **mini-OS**, but it's not the average "simulator" with limited possibilities and scripted outcomes,  
it's an **ultimate one**: 
  - An SDK for software developing (W.I.P. on the wiki)
  - A realistic *INIT* system
  - An auto Update system
  - A **real** package manager ! (see (here)[https://github.com/FrenchPythonLover/IZOSBASEAPPS])
To start, simply get the website from the latest release, then simply run these commands:
### Linux: 
`./runsetup.sh`  
Then:
`./run.sh`  
### Windows:
`./runsetup.bat`  
Then:
`./run.bat`
